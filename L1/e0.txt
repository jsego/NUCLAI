Architecting HAL9000
====================

----

Computation Phases
==================

* Sense

    - Read written sentences
	- Language english

* Think

    - Language processing to reason about the conversation (common goal, adversarial, ...)
	- Predict user intentions
	- Sentence generation

* Act
    
	- Write the generated sentence
	- Interaction with the spaceship


----

Functional Layers
=================

Animation
	- Print generated sentences in the terminal
	- Interaction with the spaceship (doors open/close, lights, ...)

Locomotion
	- Physics of acceleration/deceleration of objects like doors
	- Sense of gravity
	- Spaceship bounds (walls, floor, roof, ...)

Navigation
	- Reply correct information to move between rooms

Tactics
	- To reasong about the conversation (common goal, adversarial, ...)
