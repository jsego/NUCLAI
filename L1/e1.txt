Interfacing with HAL9000
========================

----

External Data vs. Internal Memory
=================================

* Internal Memory

	- Information about the conversation with the user, because we may know in a higher level how is the dialogue going, what is the goal, if the user is trying to cheat...
	- Update information of the gramatical structures and lexic to adapt to a dialogue.

* External Data

    - What the user writes in the terminal

----

Push vs. Pull
=============

* Polling

    - The input sentences of the user.

* Events

    - Process output data after receiving the user input.
